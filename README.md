## Task

Create an application which can be used for calculation of the cost from a housing loan.
The application should have a simple user interface (web or console) where the user can specify the desired
amount and the payback time in years. For simplicity we assume a fixed interest of 3.5% per year during the
complete payback time. The interest should be connected to the loan type in such a manner that different
loan types can have different interests. When selecting amount and payback time, the application should
generate a monthly payback plan based on the series loan principle, i.e. you pay back an equal amount each
month and add the generated interest. The interest is calculated every month.
The application should be made in such a manner that it can easily be extended to calculate a payment plan
for other types of loans, for instance car loan, spending loan etc. with different interests. Also bear in mind
that it should be easy to extend the application to cover other payback schemes as well. We do not expect
this to be implemented.
